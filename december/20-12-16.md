# Class Notes

#### Review from yesterday:

* Issues:

* Pull requestes:

* Clone:
Whenever merging to update the main, go to the main and git merge branch(source) main(target).

* Fork: Whenever you want to work on someone else project. 


## Git pulling from someone repos and git push to your own repos

**Clone the repository you want access to**
`git clone` (past the origin)

**Updating the clone repository**
git fetch upstream(name of the connection)
git pull mainstream main
qa
**Checking your origin connection**
>`git remote` /*check which connections this cloned repos have*/
`git remote rename origin upstream` /*change the origin connection*/

**Adding your github origin link**
`git remote add origin git@github.com:thesergioliveira/reposname.git`

**Pulling and Pushing with two origins**
`git pull origin upstream (new name for the cloned repos connection)` /*pulling from github updates for the clonned repos*/

`git add . && git commit -m "new update"` /*commiting the updates so that you can push into your own repos*/
`git push -u origin main` /*pushing updates to your repos*/
