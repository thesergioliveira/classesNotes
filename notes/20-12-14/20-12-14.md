#Class Notes

###Creating a repository on github

The process is composed with two steps:
 ==1- Create a repository (repos) on github, and copy the origin upstream link for the repos.== 
 ==2- Go to terminal local machine, and past the instructions for the new repos:==
 <code>mkdir newDir(directory name)</code> /*This will create a directory to contain your repository*/
 <code>echo "#reposname" >> README.md</code> /*This creates a a file and adds the name of the repos in the 1st line.*/
 <code>git init</code> /*Initializes git on the new repos locally*/
 <code> git branch -M main</code> /*This will change the name of the `master` branch to `main`*/
 <code>git remote add origin (paste here the upstream repos link)</code> /*This will connect that local directory with your repository on github*/
 <code>git add . && git commit -m "your message"</code> /*This will register on you git log the activities you just performed*/
 <code>git push -u origin main(if on a branch, use branch name)</code> /*This will push all the changes you made locally to your github directory*/
